# Integration to NuXMV

This folder contains plugins for the mapping of high-level Gamma (composite) models to NuXMV through a symbolic transition system formalism (xSTS). The plugins provide support for the seamless integration of Gamma and NuXMV, that is, the construction of queries, their evaluation using NuXMV, and the back-annotation of the verification results in addition to the automatic transformation of the Gamma models.

## Setup

1. Set up an Eclipse with the [core Gamma plugins](../README.md).
2. Set up [NuXMV](https://nuxmv.fbk.eu/pmwiki.php?n=Main.HomePage).
   - *Windows*

3. Set up the plugins in this folder.
